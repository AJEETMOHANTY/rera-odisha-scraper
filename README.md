# RERA Odisha Project Scraper

A Playwright-based Python script that scrapes real estate project details from the official [RERA Odisha website](https://rera.odisha.gov.in/projects/project-list). Extracts project name, registration number, promoter company details, and GST number.

## What It Does

- Navigates the project listing page.
- Opens individual project detail pages.
- Extracts:
  - Project Name
  - RERA Registration Number
  - Promoter Company Name
  - Promoter Office Address
  - GST Number

## How It Works

- Uses *Playwright (sync API)* for browser automation.
- Opens each project detail in sequence.
- Waits for loaders and dynamic content to load.
- Handles errors and incomplete data gracefully.
- Collects and prints data for the first 6 projects (customizable).

## How to Run

### 1. Install Playwright and Dependencies

pip install playwright
python -m playwright install

### 2. Run the Script

python scrape_rera.py
